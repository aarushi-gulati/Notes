**Optical fibre** - A thin flexible fibre with a glass core through which light signals can be sent with very little loss of strength.
* It offers high transmission capacity (10^12 bits/second - 1 bit travels in one picosecond). 

	Capacity is measured in bits and bandwidth is calculated in hertz. 

* It offers very low (about 1 decibel per kilometre) attenuation. (Attenuation is the loss of light or signal.)

* Initial transmitted power is very less. 
* Per bit transmission bit is very less. (something of the order X crores per 10^12 bit)

<u>Numerical aperture</u> - Parameter which helps in determining how much amount of light can be coupled inside an optical fibre from the source. 

	The sine of the largest angle an incident ray can have for total internal reflectance in the core.

eg:- NA = 0.3 implies that 30% light is coupled from source to fibre. 
* Offers very low EMI (Electromagnetic interference). 
* Fibre is light in weight. 
* It's made of silica which is readily available. 

Disadvantage:- 
* Optical fibres cannot be used for broadcast. 

**Total Internal Reflection** - Light needs to travel from denser to rarer medium. 
**Relative refractive index** - (n1 - n2) / n1

## Errors 
1. Longitudnal 
2. Lateral 
3. Angular
## Types of Refractive Index profiles 
1. <u>Step Index fibre</u> - Constant refractive index within the core and another constant refractive index within the cladding. Refractive index of core is somewhat more as compared to that of the cladding - intuitively bhi you can understand this because we want total internal reflection to happen.

2. <u> GRIN (Graded Index) </u> - Core (NOT cladding) has a refractive index that decreases continuously with increasing radial distance from the optical axis of the fibre.

Alpha is a parameter which controls the shape of the profile within the core.

	For Parabolic, alpha = 2. 

<u>V - number or Normalised frequency </u> - It's a dimensionless optical parameter which helps in determining roughly the number of modes that can be supported by an optical fibre.
