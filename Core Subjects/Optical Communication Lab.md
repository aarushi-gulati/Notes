## Introduction

#### Advantages of Optical Communication 
- High security 
- Low bit error rate 
- Good for long distance communication 
- Per bit cost of transmission is very low (although bohot costly hota hain optical communication, but because it is able to transmit large number of bits at once, per bit costing kaafi kam ho jaati hain)
- High speed 
- Electromagnetic compatibility 

Operating wavelengths - 850, 1310, 1550 nm (1550 latest hain)

Due to properties of Silica, losses are maximum at 1400 nm. 

#### Disadvantage
It cannot be used for broadcasting. 

#### Total Internal Reflection 
Light needs to travel from ==denser to rarer medium. ==
==Angle of incidence <= Critical Angle==

#### Relative Refractive index
